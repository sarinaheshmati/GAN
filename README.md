## Introduction
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. A GAN consists of two neural networks, a **generator** and a **discriminator**, playing a min-max game (The formula). The generator takes random noise as input and generates images, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated images. The goal is for the generator to create realistic images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from the real ones.

## Dataset
We use the **MNIST** dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The generator model transforms a random input vector (size 100) into a 28x28 image that mimics the MNIST digits.

## Model Architecture
1. **Generator (G):**
   - Takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a 28x28 image using transposed convolutional layers.
   - The aim is to generate images that resemble the MNIST dataset.

2. **Discriminator (D):**
   - A CNN-based binary classifier that tries to classify images as real or fake.
   - Trained to distinguish between real MNIST images and those generated by G.

## Loss Function
The GAN uses the **binary cross-entropy** loss function:
- **Discriminator** aims to maximize the probability of correctly classifying real and fake images.
- **Generator** aims to minimize the probability that the discriminator correctly classifies generated images as fake.

## Training Process
- First, the discriminator is trained on both real and fake images.
- Then, the generator is trained to produce images that the discriminator labels as real.
- The process is repeated for multiple epochs, improving both models.

## Results
After training, the generator produces images that closely resemble handwritten digits, and the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing real from fake images.
